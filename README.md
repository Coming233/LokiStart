# LokiStart Project

This powershell scripts meant to help you download and install all the mandatory software tools when they choose [CC23xx](https://www.ti.com/product/CC2340R5) the MCU based BLE (low energy bluetooth) chip designed and manufactured by [Texas Instruments](https://www.ti.com/).

## How to use
1. Open the LokiStar_release_vx.0.ps1 with VS Code
```
Note:
- For release v1.0, you should change the download directory to your own manually.
- For release v2.0, you should change `USER_NAME` desfined in the script to your own user name on your PC.
```
2. Change the URL of the software if needed.
3. Save the script and open a powershell terminal in the downloading directory.
```c
.\LokiStart_release_v2.0.ps1
```

## Feature Not Support

I don't want to make this tools so sofisticated, so there won't be so much features in this project.

**You have my word, simple is more.**

1. Do not need to change the script, just run it, and it will prepare all the softwares
- [Why not] I want to download the softwares under `.\Downloads\`, so it needs your own user name on a specific PC.
2. Select the versions of the software you want.
- [Why Not] Because I have no time to do it now.
3. Check whether the download is successful.
- [Why Not] I'm still learning how to do it.

## Plan for the change

I will update the scripts when new SDK released.
